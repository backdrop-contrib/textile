The Textile module allows you to enter content using Textile, a
simple, plain text syntax that is filtered into valid XHTML. The
module can filter version one and version two (currently in beta)
syntax. Additionally, Textile filtering can be enabled and disabled on
a per-node basis. The Textile page found at
<http://your_drupal_site/textile> provides syntax descriptions and
examples.

More information about Textile can be found at the Textile home page
<http://textism.com/tools/textile/>.

NOTE: Drupal's current filter implementation is not the most efficient
and will be reworked in upcoming releases. This module should perform
well on most sites; however, extremely busy sites may experience a
performance hit (especially with caching disabled) performing all of
the regular expression matching involved with Textile.
