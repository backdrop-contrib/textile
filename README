The Textile module allows you to enter content using Textile, a
simple, plain text syntax that is filtered into valid XHTML. The
filter tips found at <http://your_drupal_site/filter/tips> provides
syntax descriptions and examples.

More information about Textile can be found at the Textile home page
<http://textism.com/tools/textile/>.

NOTE: Drupal's current filter implementation is not the most efficient
and will be reworked in upcoming releases. This module should perform
well on most sites; however, extremely busy sites may experience a
performance hit (especially with caching disabled) performing all of
the regular expression matching involved with Textile.
