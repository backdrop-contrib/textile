textile.module
INSTALL
$Id$

Installation of textile.module could not be simpler. Simply copy the
textile directory, containing the textile.module and Textile.php files
to your Drupal modules directory. Then log into your site and go to
the module configuration page and enable the Textile module.

NOTE: Drupal's current filter implementation is not the most efficient
and will be reworked in upcoming releases. This module should perform
well on most sites; however, extremely busy sites may experience a
performance hit (especially with caching disabled) performing all of
the regular expression matching involved with Textile.
