-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5.1-php-r1    2004-08-08    passes regression testing

                              bugfix: missing escapes in regex definition 
                              within EducateQuotes() caused some opening
                              straight quotes to be missed (introduced in 1.5.1-b1)

                              bugfix: DO_STUPEFY token value was the same
                              as DO_QUOT_CONV ?! (Doh!) (introduced in 1.4.1)

                              bugfix: SmartyPants function did not set $do_stupefy.
                              (introduced in 1.4.1) Thanks to Kevin Papendick for 
                              pointing this out.

                              feature: max loop count in _tokenize() function now
                              set via define(). Suggested by Kevin Papendick.

                              feature: error message upon exceeding loop-max 
                              can now be ignored silently; behavior can be set
                              via define(). Suggested by Kevin Papendick.

                              change: max loop count in _tokenize() raised
                              from 100 to 2000, to reduce the likelihood of
                              anyone ever encountering a _tokenize() failure.

                              Note: thanks to Alexander Rosenberg, 1.5.1-php-r1 retains
                              compatibility with PHP 4.3.2. Previous versions required
                              PHP 4.3.3. This is good news for MacOS X 10.3.4 users, 
                              because 4.3.2 is the version of PHP that ships with the OS.

1.5.1-php-b1    2004-07-03    upgrades from SmartyPants 1.5.1
                              Now compatible with PHP 4.3.2

                              This release was submitted by Alexander M. Rosenberg.

1.4.1-php-r2    2004-03-02    changed $tags_to_skip to define()d value
                              to avoid scope problems (in calling SmartyPants()
                              from inside a function)

                              changed $VERSION to define()d value to avoid
                              namespace collisions with other libraries

                              added test to have SmartyPonts and EducateQuotes
                              functions return immediately if $text is empty

                              added link to Smarty output filter for 
                              SmartyPants-PHP to README

                              Thanks to Joe Stump <http://www.jcssolutions.com> 
                              for the feedback and Smarty output filter.

1.4.1-php       2004-02-21    initial release
