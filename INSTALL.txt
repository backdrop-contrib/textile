Installation of textile.module could not be simpler. Simply copy the
entire textile directory to your Drupal modules directory. Then log
into your site and go to the module configuration page and enable the
Textile module. Finally, add the Textile filter to the desired input
format(s).  If you are using the title module, you will need to ensure
that Textile comes before the title module on the filter ordering
page.
