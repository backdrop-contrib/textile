For a new installation, copy the entire textile module directory to the appropriate module directory within your Drupal installation. 

Then download the most up to date (2.0.0 or later) textile library from thresholdstate:

http://textile.thresholdstate.com/

The library should be availble via a link on the right in tar.gz or zip formats. Uncompress the download, and place the classTextile.php file into the same directory as textile.module.

Then log into your site, enable the Textile module on the admin/build/modules page. Finally, you must add the Textile filter to the appropriate input formats and set any desired configuration options.
