Installation
------------
Install the Textile module as you would any Backdrop module.

The module requires the Textile PHP class library, and a recent version is
included. Before enabling the module, you must ensure that the Textile library
(Parser.php) is included in your Backdrop installation. See External
Dependencies below for details.

After enabling the module, you must add the Textile filter to the appropriate
input formats and set any desired configuration options.

NOTE: You need to be careful with the order of your input filters. It is
recommended to set up a special filter for textile, disable the line-break
converter, set up the HTML filter to run AFTER textile, and only allow the types
of tags you want to permit.


External dependencies
---------------------
This module depends on the Textile PHP class from the PHP-Textile project [1].
The library Parser.php and related files are packaged in the
src/Netcarver/Textile directory of that project. A recent version is packaged
with this module and can be found inside the include directory present in the
directory containing the module, or alternatively managed as an external library
(see the optional "Libraries configuration" below). PHP-Textile now uses three
class files, though only one of them is needed for this module. However, all
three (Parser.php, DataBag.php, and Tag .php) should be installed to avoid
missing class errors.

To have the latest version of the library, you may download the most recent
PHP-Textile zip or tarball from [1] and extract the Parser.php and
related files.

The file may also be obtained directly from the GitHub repository. The most
recent stable version can be found by browsing the project repository [2].

  * Navigate to the master branch (latest version 4.1.1 at the time of writing).
  * Navigate to the src/Netcarver/Textile directory.
  * Download the Parser.php, DataBag.php, and Tag.php files (e.g., right click,
    and select "save as") or copy the URLs of the files and use wget/curl to
    obtain them via the command line.


Libraries configuration (optional)
----------------------------------
This module for Backdrop bundles the required external libraries with the
module files. However, should the libraries need to be shared across modules,
to maintain compatability this module still searches several locations for the
Parser class files. Instructions for the Drupal 7 module are shown below.

  From version 7.x-2.0-rc8 and onward, this module supports placing the Textile
  class in a separate shared location within your Drupal installation.

  To create a library for Textile, create a directory called 'textile' in one of
  the recommended locations for shared libraries. The locations where the
  'textile' directory is searched are:

    * sites/all/libraries/textile
    * sites/$domain/libraries/textile
    * profiles/$profile/libraries/textile

  $domain is the domain name, and $profile is the currently used profile name.
