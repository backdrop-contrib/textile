* For a new installation, copy the entire textile module directory to the
  appropriate module directory within your Drupal installation.

* Download the most up to date textile library from TextPattern [1]

* The library should be availble via a link on the right in tar.gz or zip
  formats. Uncompress the download, and place the classTextile.php file
  into the same directory as textile.module.

* Log into your site, enable the Textile module on the
  admin/build/modules/include page. Finally, you must add the Textile filter to
  the appropriate input formats and set any desired configuration options.
  Version 7.x-2-0-rc8 and forward look for the Textile library also outside the
  directory where the module is copied, such as
  /sites/all/libraries/textile, or profiles/$profile/libraries/textile
  (where $profile is the currently used profile).

NOTE: You need to be careful with the order of your input filters. I
recommend setting up a special filter for textile: Disable the
line-break converter, set up the HTML filter to run AFTER textile,
and only allow the types of tags you want to permit.
