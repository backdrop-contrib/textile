textile.module
INSTALL

Installation of textile.module could not be simpler. Simply copy the
textile directory, containing the textile.module and related PHP files
to your Drupal modules directory. Then log into your site and go to
the following address (assuming you have clean URLs turned on):

  http://<your_drupal_site>/admin/system/filters

Here you can specify which version(s) of Textile should be available
for creating content. Additionally, you can go to

  http://<your_drupal_site>/admin/node/settings

On this page you can specify the default Textile input option that
will be used for each type of node on your site.

NOTE: Drupal's current filter implementation is not the most efficient
and will be reworked in upcoming releases. This module should perform
well on most sites; however, extremely busy sites may experience a
performance hit (especially with caching disabled) performing all of
the regular expression matching involved with Textile.
